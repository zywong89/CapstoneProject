All codes here aim to describe the concept of how the text prediction model is implemented.
Paths to access cetain files (including the file names) need to be modified according to own use, so certainly it will not work if you simply copy, paste and run the code on R console.
Definitely it is very difficult to build everything on scratch and by my own, so undeniably there will be minor similarities to some other works around, and I have tried my very best to build my own pieces.
Anyhow, hope this repo helps anyone who needs help. Good luck!
